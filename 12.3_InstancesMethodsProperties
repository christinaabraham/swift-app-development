/* Create a variable for myPlans, initialized to a string describing your evening plans.
Create a second variable for friendPlans, but initialize it to myPlans. (Your friend takes less initiative than you at planning.)
Below the declaration of friendPlans, update myPlans by using the addition operator + to add one more activity.
