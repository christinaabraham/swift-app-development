// Exercise: Treehouse Pulley

// Create three constants for items of different weights that you'd like to bring up to your fort: 
// One less than 100, one between 100 and 1000, and one over 1000.

let bagOfChips = TreehousePulley(weightCapacity: 5)
let stackOfBooks = TreehousePulley(weightCapacity: 350)
let table = TreehousePulley(weightCapacity: 1100)


// Create a second pulley that has a higher capacity and can hold at least ten times the weight of the ricketyRope.
var ricketyRope = TreehousePulley(weightCapacity: 200)
var highCapacityRope = TreehousePulley(weightCapacity: 3000)
